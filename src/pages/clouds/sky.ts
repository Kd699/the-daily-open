// cloud mood that multiplies the user's Fullness/Intensity sliders. Moods
// deliberately have NO size axis: fullness and density fade a cloud in
// place, but size would rescale the cloud field and physically rearrange
// the sky on every preset switch — a switch changes the time of day over
// the clouds that are there, it does not move them.
// Hours assume the default view (lat 35, day 172): the sun rises near solar
// 4.8 and sets near 19.2, so Sunrise/Sunset sit just past those edges where
// the colour actually happens, and Dusk is civil twilight — sun down, sky
// still burning. Moods: sunrise and sunset arrive with fuller decks to
// catch the colour (the Blissful reference frames), morning is thin airy
// wisps on light blue, dusk broods — fuller and denser, the storm end of
// the range — and night strips the sky back so the stars own it.
