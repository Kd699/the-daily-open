// The /clouds scene: geospatial volumetric clouds (@takram/three-clouds)
// lit and composited by @takram/three-atmosphere, dialled by DialKit.
// This is the VOLUMETRIC engine; an Engine dial swaps it for the wisps
// engine (clouds-wisps.tsx) — the same presets painted by one lightweight
// procedural shader. Shared sky vocabulary lives in ./sky.ts.
//
// HOW THE PIECES COMPOSE. Clouds is a postprocessing effect, not a mesh: it
// ray-marches cloud density into buffers inside EffectComposer, and
// AerialPerspective (from the atmosphere package) composites those buffers
// while drawing the sky and applying sun/sky irradiance — which is why the
// two must sit together inside <Atmosphere>. The camera lives in real ECEF
// coordinates on the WGS84 ellipsoid, so "where you are" is a geodetic
// longitude/latitude/height, not an arbitrary scene position.
//
// SKY IS A PRESET, TIME IS THE STYLE (after Steve Lauda's Blissful sky,
// x.com/stevelauda_/status/2066417007038521475). One select steps the sky
// through Pre-dawn → Night, and each stop is a real solar hour, the exposure
// that makes that hour legible, a postcard heading, and a cloud MOOD — the
// atmosphere model does the palette (indigo twilight, peach at sunrise,
// saturated midday blue, ember dusk) and the mood decides whether the hour
// arrives with big soft clouds, thin wisps, or a brooding deck. "Live" is
// the default and the easter egg: the visitor's own clock is the solar hour,
// interpolating between the neighbouring stops.
//
// SWITCHING SKIES: THE DAY TURNS OVER A STILL SKY. Every animated quantity
// — solar hour, exposure, heading/pitch, cloud coverage/density, star
// brightness — is evaluated per frame from ONE fixed-duration tween and
// written STRAIGHT ONTO the CloudsEffect / renderer / camera (zero React
// re-renders per frame). Tweens, not damped lerp, on purpose: exponential
// smoothing moves FASTEST in its first frame — an early cut read as zooming
// through space — where an ease-in-out starts still, breathes through the
// middle and lands softly. Three tempos off one clock (see TWEEN_KEYS):
// light ~2.5s, camera ~5s, cloud fade ~4s. And the clouds NEVER MOVE on a
// switch: no weather scroll beyond the dialled wind, no mood-driven
// rescale — the same clouds hold their places while the time of day
// changes over them. Hour and heading interpolate circularly
// (midday→night rolls forward, not back through morning). Honours
// prefers-reduced-motion by snapping.
//
// THE CAMERA IS A DIAL, NOT A GESTURE. No OrbitControls: the view is fixed,
// a postcard rather than a fly-through, and the only way to move it is the
// View folder (geodetic location plus heading/pitch in the local east-
// north-up frame). Selecting a sky swings the heading dial to that sky's
// postcard direction; the dial stays live on top.
//
// THE CLOUDS ARE FOUR WORDS, not fourteen parameters: Speed, Fullness,
// Intensity, Size — the Blissful vocabulary. The package's default layers
// are disabled and one thin, eroded layer is dialled instead; the preset
// mood multiplies the sliders, so the same hand-set character reads calm at
// midday and stormy at dusk. Everything else — quality preset, clump
// sharpness, layer altitude/thickness — is real but secondary, so it lives
// in a collapsed Advanced folder.
//
// The default weather/shape/turbulence/star textures stream from the takram
// packages' GitHub media host on first load; nothing is bundled here.
